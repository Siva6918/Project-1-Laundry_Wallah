        <h1>Welcome to Laundry Wallah / Laundry Mart</h1>
    </header>
    <p> A laundry wallah (or "dhobi" in traditional Indian contexts) is a professional who provides laundry services. This term is commonly used in South Asia, particularly in India, to describe individuals who wash, dry, and iron clothes for customers, either manually or using machines.</p>
    <h3>Key Aspects:</h3>
     <ul>
        <li><b>Traditional Role</b>: In the past, laundry wallahs would hand-wash clothes in rivers or communal washing areas, using soap or natural cleaning agents. The cleaned clothes were sun-dried and pressed with heavy irons heated by charcoal.</li>
        <li><b>Modern Evolution</b>: With the advent of technology, many laundry wallahs now use washing machines and modern equipment while still maintaining personalized services like home pickup and delivery.</li>
        <li><b>Cultural Importanc</b>e: In many regions, laundry wallahs form an essential part of the local economy and household routines, providing an affordable and convenient alternative to self-laundry services.</li>
    </ul>
